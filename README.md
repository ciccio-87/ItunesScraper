ItunesScraper
=============

Just a quick and dirty example Python script which scrapes
the games section of Itunes.

dependencies:
  - BeautifulSoup (bs4)
  - SQLite 3

scrapmyass.py (a slightly modified version of a @leresearcher script) 
  is used to build a proxy list
  
I used to borrow a useragent list from @sqlmapproject, but i prefered not
to share it, because my project does not have a clear license yet.
